Practicing on this then will do red/black if I feel the need to practice rust more before a real project.

Focusing on this then will worry aobut red/black, need to figure out lifetime on rust before I can continue red/black.
Also thought seperating the two will be best to make it clean.

Edit 2024-05-02: I'm learning about how much I don't know about rust, I think my naive solution is fine for everything but deletion (incomplete), although it may not be the most "rust" way I can refactor after doing deletion.
Will see, I see HashMap<k, v>, Rc<T> (although Rc<T>  is meant for graphs), all I think about is trying to find a solution for this now, it's frustrating but feels nice to have a hurdle to want to solve this much.
I think I know what I want to do for a first project, even two projects, but I think it's too early to commit to anything. https://iced.rs/ is also cool. 

I was sent this when I asked for help on resources / pointers on where I went wrong in my thinking. Apparently writing linked-nodes in rust safely can be "not easy" compared to other languages so I feel less emberassed by the time taken
to learn rust so far. Linked: https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/
