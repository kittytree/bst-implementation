# bst-implementation

Trvial implementation of a basic BST in Rust. Just did it to learn Rust as a first Rust project, nothing more than that. 

Forced me to learn Rust in a postive way, learnt the "restrictions" of what being memory "safe" can effect. Overall had fun, hardest language to implement this is that I've tried in so far. Super fun language overall, just not the most fun to implement DSAs in as someone new to the language.
